# Agent Loop: targeted product repair

The default loop lives inside one TODO task: maker -> deterministic checks ->
independent reviewer -> actionable REPAIR to maker -> retest -> ACCEPT.
For a single small task use `agent-graph/scripts/todo_pair.py --todo <todo.json>
--run-dir <absolute-evidence-dir>`. It reuses this loop without graph scheduling.
Use TODO Graph only for real parallel branches or dependencies.

Do not create a separate Loop contract or graph for each repair. Retain the
workspace, exact findings and relevant tests. No recursive Fleet, no audit of
the reviewer, no new architecture planning for a local defect.
Stop blind repetition after the same artifact and findings occur twice.
Diagnose infrastructure errors separately from product defects. Malformed review
must not trigger recoding. Token totals are telemetry; actual provider limits and
explicit owner limits are not bypassed.
An unchanged artifact and identical checks retain their successful test evidence
when only the review/report transport is repaired. A changed artifact invalidates
that evidence. Neither a valid report nor an ACK grants product acceptance.

Legacy search/training/certified loops remain available for their existing
scientific contracts. Do not silently migrate or weaken those contracts.

## Runtime identity

```powershell
$suite = if ($env:AGENT_FLEET_SUITE_ROOT) { $env:AGENT_FLEET_SUITE_ROOT } else { "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\runtime\agent-fleet-suite\lean-0.9.142" }
$expectedRuntime = "e1c59b4b427a96656bcaf1a3a14638cbcfdbf4bfa63cc63a1568130bed4acc58"
python "$suite\agent-fleet\scripts\verify_runtime.py" --runtime-root $suite --expected-fingerprint $expectedRuntime --package-version 0.9.142
```

Verify once per unchanged work wave. If verification fails, diagnose the exact files; do not silently switch to another runtime. Existing legacy current runtime is not modified by this release.
